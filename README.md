Guided user to next steps in the app

Concepts Used:

Console output (System.out.println)

Basic string display

Program structure and flow

Use Case 2: Hardcoded Palindrome Check
Used hardcoded string "madam"
Reversed string using loop
Compared original and reversed string
Printed result using if-else
Use Case 3: Palindrome Check Using String Reverse
Goal: Check whether a string is a palindrome by reversing it.

Flow:

Reverse string using loop
Compare original and reversed string
Display result
Concepts Used:

for loop
String immutability
String concatenation
equals() method
Use Case 4: Character Array Based Palindrome Check
Goal: Convert string to char[] and compare characters using two-pointer technique.

Flow:

Convert string to char array
Use start and end pointers
Compare characters
Display result
Concepts Used:

char[] array
Array indexing
Two-pointer technique
Efficient comparison without extra string objects
Use Case 5: Stack-Based Palindrome Checker
Goal: Use stack to reverse characters and validate palindrome.

Flow:

Push characters into stack
Pop characters in reverse order
Compare with original string
Display result
Concepts Used:

Stack (LIFO)
push() and pop()
Reversal using stack
Use Case 6: Queue + Stack Based Palindrome Check
Goal: Demonstrate FIFO vs LIFO using Queue and Stack.

Flow:

Enqueue characters into queue
Push characters into stack
Compare dequeue and pop results
Display result
Concepts Used:

Queue (FIFO)
Stack (LIFO)
enqueue & dequeue
push & pop
Logical comparison
Use Case 7: Deque-Based Optimized Palindrome Check
Goal: Use Deque to compare front and rear characters efficiently.

Flow:

Insert characters into deque
Remove first & last characters
Compare until empty
Display result
Concepts Used:

Deque (Double Ended Queue)
Front & Rear access
Optimized data handling
Use Case 8: Linked List Based Palindrome Check
Goal: Check palindrome using singly linked list.

Flow:

Convert string to linked list
Reverse second half
Compare halves
Display result
Concepts Used:

Singly Linked List
Node traversal
Fast & Slow pointer technique
In-place reversal
Use Case 9: Recursive Palindrome Check
Goal: Check palindrome using recursion.

Flow:

Recursive call compares start & end characters
Base condition exits recursion
Display result
Concepts Used:

Recursion
Base condition
Call stack
Use Case 10: Case-Insensitive & Space-Ignored Palindrome
Goal: Ignore spaces and case while checking a palindrome.

Flow:

Normalize the string (remove spaces, punctuation, lowercase)
Apply two-pointer palindrome logic
Display result
Concepts Used:

String preprocessing
Regular expressions
Two-pointer comparison
Use Case 11: Object-Oriented Palindrome Service
Created PalindromeChecker class

Exposed checkPalindrome() method

Normalized input string

Compared characters using internal logic

printed result showing whether input is a palindrome

Concepts Used:

Encapsulation

Single Responsibility Principle

ternal data handling (Stack / Array)

Use Case 12: Strategy Pattern for Palindrome Algorithms
Goal: Choose palindrome algorithm dynamically at runtime.

Flow:

Define PalindromeStrategy interface
Implement StackStrategy and DequeStrategy
Inject strategy into context
Execute dynamically
Concepts Used:

Interface
Polymorphism
Strategy Pattern
Runtime behavior switching
Use Case 13: Performance Comparison
Goal: Compare the execution performance of different palindrome algorithms.

Flow:

Run multiple algorithms: Stack, Deque, Two-Pointer
Capture execution time using System.nanoTime()
Display results for each
Concepts Used:

System.nanoTime()
Algorithm comparison
Stack, Deque, Array
